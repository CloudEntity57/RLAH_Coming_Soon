# RLAH_Coming_Soon
A bi-weekly caravan tour to preview properties not listed in Bright MLS for agents of RLAH Real Estate and DCRE.
CONFIDENTIAL

What: A bi-weekly caravan tour to preview properties not listed in Bright MLS for agents of RLAH Real Estate and DCRE.

Why:  The traditional “Broker Open” is dead. There needs to be a reason for agents to visit a property at a prescribed time when they can otherwise do it at their convenience. Seeing something early, before it’s available, is a good reason. 

Who:  The tour is limited to members of DCRE and RLAH.  Agents can register as a “Host” or a “Guest” for each upcoming tour.  Both Hosts and Guests are expected to attend all 4 properties on the tour.  Guests are expected to RSVP so that staff can plan accordingly.  Unregistered guests can stop at any or all of the properties by using their own transportation.

Where: Hosts and Guests will meet at first property. Property and schedule will be determined by 6pm the night before.  All properties must be within the 2 mile map which combines a 2 mile radius around 11 Dupont Circle NW and 1405 Rhode Island NW.

When: 1st and 3rd Tuesday of every month. Begins at 9:30am and will be over by approximately 11:30.  Each property will have a stop of approximately 15-20 minutes.

How to Register: comingsoontour.com

How to stay informed: Tour information will be listed on the website and outlined in an email that will be sent to ALL members of participating brokerages. 

Logistics of Tour: The brokerages will coordinate Uber XL’s at the first property and continuously through the rest of the tour.  After the fourth property, the Uber caravan will return back to the First Property.

Property Qualifications:
1) Property is not listed in the MLS (except “Coming Soon”) at time of tour;
2) Property located within the 2 mile map;
3) Property is submitted by 11am on Monday before deadline;

After Tour:
Properties that do not qualify, but still submitted in a timely manner, will be mentioned underneath the tour. They will not be part of the “sponsored” tour, but will give guests and hosts the options to continuing touring at their own time and expense.

QUESTIONS FROM AGENTS SO FAR
Q: how many listings did we have last year in the 2 mile radius map? (are agents who don’t work in that area going to complain?) 

A: We researched DCRE “Listings Sold” within a 2 mile radius of their office, that sold within a recent 12 month period and counted 44.  We researched RLAH “Listings Sold” within a 2 mile radius of their office, that sold within a recent 12 month period and counted 31.  These counts don’t reflect the extra properties that appear when the two radius searches are combined or the properties that have not sold yet so this is a conservative total number of 75 listings a year in the proposed “2 Miler” map.

Agents may complain, it’s important that we get this right on a smaller scale before expanding.  This is a beta test. After our research and consideration of brokerage partners we believe the RLVH1 would be the best office to pilot this from.

Q: do the hosts go on the tour with the visitors or do they stay at their upcoming listing?

A: “Both Hosts and Visitors are expected to attend all 4 properties on the tour.” 

Q. can the hosts essentially holding traditional brokers opens during that time (9:30-11am) in case other agents not DCRE/RLAH want to attend? Or maybe an agent just wants to see one property? 

A: Technically, yes, but the property on the Coming Soon Tour must not be “Active” in Bright MLS.  Other agents may attend and an agent from a sponsoring brokerage may just want to see one property, in that case we ask that they do not rely on sponsored transportation.  They will also not automatically receive the post-tour survey which will be valuable to our hosts, we aim to send it manually if the short-term visitor is accounted for.

Q: if someone wants to drive separately (maybe they have to go somewhere else on a schedule from the last house) will that be permitted?

A: Yes, we just request that they be mindful of our limited time at each property.  Example, agent just wants to see property #3 and they show up right before the estimated time that was posted on the agenda...they may have to wait.  In converse, the agent may show up at the estimated time and we may have been way ahead of schedule.  The host agent shall not stall to allow another showing.  The sponsored caravan takes priority with little sympathy for those not included.


Q: Broker Opens never seemed to serve a valuable purpose to me. I didn't know what the point was in seeing houses only to go back again with clients. And if I didn't have a client who was a match for a particular Broker Open I usually wouldn't go. What's the reason behind reinventing it in this way? I would go to a broker open to see it before it's listed if my buyer had a chance at locking it up before it hits the market. Or maybe if it was an RLAH agent who needed pricing help or something else.

A: These are ONLY properties that are NOT listed in MLS and one of the required selections when submitting to be a “HOST” is “Will seller show home/consider offers prior to listing? (Y/N/TBD)”.  Many times it will be a colleague needing pricing help or advice and at some point that agent will be you.  Keep in mind that whether you register to participate in a specific tour or not, every agent in all participating brokerages will receive the “Tour Agenda” which will help you get your property in front of more people and will help you know what’s coming on in the specific geographic area.

Q: If sellers did agree to show/sell in the Coming Soon period are we in violation of something - it's not quite a pocket listing but with two brokerages involved do we open ourselves up to any problems? I'm sure you thought of all that already, but it's not some sort of collusion or anything is it?

A: Seller’s instructions in writing to sell off-market would avoid any of these legal issues.  We’re also having legal counsel review the program

Q: On the website, people have to select to register as a host or visitor. But couldn't they be a host one week and then a visitor on other weeks? Would they have to register as both? Or is the registration only good for the 2 week period, then it resets? You know people will complain about that. 

A: An agent would have to register separately for each tour. Due to this question we will make that more clear and have the date of the tour displayed front and center to minimize confusion

Q: With the inventory shortage, it makes sense to try to sell more of our own listings but we have DCRE in with this so I'm not sure if that's the goal?

A: We believe partnering with somebody adds value by increasing listings and participants.  We also want to show how boutique brokerages can partner up to help each other.  There are several other brokerages that have expressed interest in partnering up with us on the project but DCRE seems like the best fit for reasons including listings in proximity to one of our offices, similarities in culture, and cooperation from brokerage principal(s).
